/*An internet cafe has 2 ways of charging. If the user is a member pays 2$/hour, Else the user pays 5$. Find if someone is a member or not and calculate the price based on how many hours the user spend. If the user is a member the tax is 10% else the tax is 20%.

        Create a program that:

        Reads how many hours the user spend
        Check if is a member
        Add the proper tax fee
        Print the total amount the user has to pay
        Output: "The user is a member stayed 2 hours for 2$/hour plus the 10% the total amount is 4.4$"
