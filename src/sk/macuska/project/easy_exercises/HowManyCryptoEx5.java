        Reads the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin
        Prints the amount of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin you can buy
        Example: money = 100, bitcoin_price = 50, ethereum_price = 25, litecoin_price = 10
        Output: "With 100$ you can buy: 2 Bitcoins, 4 Ethereum, and 10 Litecoins"
